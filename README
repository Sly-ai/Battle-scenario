Added return functions to your character's health and strength statuses from Day 27's project.
Generated two different characters and stored their data (health and strength stats, character type, name, etc.).
Used a while True loop to simulate those two characters battling.
Rolled one six-sided dice for both characters. The character who rolls the higher amount wins that round.
The winner of that round (the one who rolled the higher number) will give damage to the other character by doing the following:
Found the difference between the strengths of both opponents and add one.
Took that amount away from the loser's health.
At the end of each round, check the stats of each character to ensure neither of them has died yet.
When one character dies (they run out of health), declare a winner of the battle!
To keep this battle from looking hideous between rounds use time.sleep to pause between rounds os.system("clear") to ensure the screen clears between battles.
